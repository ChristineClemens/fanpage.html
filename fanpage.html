    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> A Coffee Appreciation Blurb </h3>
    <center>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">Stocked away among cans of tuna and packages of crumbled Melbatoast, most cupboards 
        conceal a common vice: coffee, a staple of nearly every modern household. Whether 
        it be brewed via French press or traditional filter, for the energy spike or nourishment 
        of our inner brooding artist, these seemingly magic beans are a favourite among most.</p>

    <h2 style="padding-left:100px; background-color:rgb(226, 169, 24);">An Appetizingly Ambiguous History</h2>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">Although many of coffee's various preparation methods and sources are well 
        documented today, much of its history stems from a speculative origin. With 
        certainty, it can be said that coffee's heritage can be traced back, over 
        several centuries, to the abundant coffee bean plants occupying the Ethiopian 
        plateau, the exact time frame being unknown. </p>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">It is believed that <em>Kaldi</em>, an Ethiopian goat herder, first discovered 
        the coffee bean and the lively benefits of caffeine after observing his goats 
        consume the berries from a certain tree, later to be coined <em>coffea</em>. 
        His herd exhibited spikes in energy so excessive that it often prevented sleep. </p>
    <p style="text-indent:30px;">These findings were reported to the abbot of the local monastery, who was later 
        responsible for concocting a drink from the berries identified, allowing him to 
        remain energetic and alert during the practice of evening prayer. This discovery 
        was eventually shared with other members of the monastery, an inside secret that 
        very quickly spread by word of mouth and was soon carried across the globe. </p>
